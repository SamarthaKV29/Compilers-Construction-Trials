Grammar

Rule 0     S' -> exp
Rule 1     exp -> GETIC
Rule 2     exp -> EXIT

Terminals, with rules where they appear

COMMA                : 
COPY                 : 
DOT                  : 
EXIT                 : 2
GETIC                : 1
JUMPBACK             : 
JUMPFWD              : 
MINUS                : 
NEXTBIT              : 
PLUS                 : 
PREVBIT              : 
error                : 

Nonterminals, with rules where they appear

exp                  : 0

Parsing method: LALR

state 0

    (0) S' -> . exp
    (1) exp -> . GETIC
    (2) exp -> . EXIT

    GETIC           shift and go to state 1
    EXIT            shift and go to state 2

    exp                            shift and go to state 3

state 1

    (1) exp -> GETIC .

    $end            reduce using rule 1 (exp -> GETIC .)


state 2

    (2) exp -> EXIT .

    $end            reduce using rule 2 (exp -> EXIT .)


state 3

    (0) S' -> exp .
